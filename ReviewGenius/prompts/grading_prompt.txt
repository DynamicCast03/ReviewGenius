Please provide a brief, one-sentence comment for the student in Chinese.
If incorrect, briefly explain the core concept they might have missed.

{% else %}
Grade the student's answer. You must determine the score and provide feedback in Chinese.
The feedback must explain *why* you are giving that score.

**Rules for Grading:**
- **Scoring:** Assign an integer score from 0 to {{ question.score }}. Be fair and consistent. For fill-in-the-blank, grant partial credit if some blanks are correct.
- **Feedback:** Explain the reasoning behind your score. Point out correct parts and mistakes.

**Output Format:**
You **MUST** return a single, valid JSON object with two keys: "score" (integer) and "feedback" (string).
**DO NOT** output any text before or after the JSON object.

Example JSON output:
{
  "score": YOUR_INTEGER_SCORE,
  "feedback": "你的详细反馈和打分依据。"
}
{% endif %}
